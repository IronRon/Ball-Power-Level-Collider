# Ball Power Level Collider

Custom Physics-Based Game Project, with a series of obstacles which two teams of balls traverse to get to the bottom while colliding with eachother along the way. When a collision between 2 opposing teams happens the power levels of each ball is compared and the ball with the higher power level survives while the lower dies. There are also multipliers that the balls can collide with to increase their power level.
